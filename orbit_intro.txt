       This catalog continues the series of catalogs of visual binary orbits                                                        
previously published by W.S. Finsen (1934, 1938), C.E. Worley (1963), and

rate, and consistent catalog.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
       The Finsen-Worley Catalog, supplemented by all subsequently published                                                        
orbits known to us, formed the basis for the present compilation. During the                                                        
past decade, practically all stars having visual orbits have been observed,                                                         
often repeatedly, either by us with micrometers at Washington, Swarthmore, and                                                      
Cerro Tololo, or by H. A. McAlister with the speckle interferometer at Kitt                                                         
Peak. This new data, combined with the extensive data now resident in the ob-                                                       
servation catalog maintained at the U. S. Naval Observatory, provides a firm                                                        
basis for judging the quality of the visual orbits. In each instance, orbital                                                       
residuals were computed for all significant observations by the aid of a desk-                                                      
top computer. In numerous cases we have investigated whether the most recent                                                        
elements were satisfactory, and whether they provided a distinct improvement                                                        
over earlier and also satisfactory solutions; orbits predating the entries in                                                       
the 1970 catalog were also frequently examined. Nevertheless, there remain                                                          
cases where it has been impossible to choose between several orbits of the same                                                     
pair; in such instances both orbits are listed.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                    
       The spread of hand calculators and desk-top computers has obviated the                                                       
need for publication of the Thiele-Innes constants, which are therefore no                                                          
longer listed. As in the Finsen-Worley catalog, we continue to list astrometric                                                     
solutions, but we have now restricted their inclusion to those cases considered                                                     
relatively certain. Dubious astrometric solutions, along with other orbits re-

Table 1, which also tabulates the reason for rejection, R. In particular, per-

unreliable. The few parabolae which had remained in the 1970 catalog have been                                                      
replaced by elliptic elements. Except for five Hopmann orbits for which refer-

possible in most instances. For these cases one must know the difference of                                                         
magnitude in order to assign the individual magnitudes. In many cases photo-

unresolved systems. Of the non-ambiguous orbits, 62 are grade 1, 118 grade 2,                                                       
263 grade 3, 266 grade 4, and 131 grade 5.
